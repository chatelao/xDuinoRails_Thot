## Signal Viewer Webtool

The project includes a web-based tool to visualize the defined signals. It is located in the `webtool` directory.

To use it:
1. Open `webtool/index.html` in a web browser.
2. Select a country from the first dropdown.
3. Select a signal from the second dropdown.
4. The visual representation of the signal will be displayed.

**Note:** Due to browser security restrictions (CORS), the tool might not work correctly if opened directly as a file (`file://...`). It is recommended to serve the project using a local web server (e.g., `python -m http.server` in the root directory) or view it hosted on GitHub Pages.
