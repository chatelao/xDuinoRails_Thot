# JMRI Signal Mast Logic (SML) Overview

JMRI's Signal Mast Logic (SML) is a powerful feature that allows for prototypical signaling on a model railroad. It uses a system of XML files to define signal systems, aspects, and appearances.

## Key Features

- **Prototypical Signaling:** SML allows for the creation of complex signaling logic that mimics real-world railroad operations.
- **Customizable:** Users can create their own signal system definitions or use one of the many pre-built definitions.
- **Aspect-based:** SML is based on the concept of signal aspects, which represent the different indications that a signal can display.
