# CV Table for the xDuino Locomotive Decoder

This document describes the Configuration Variables (CVs) for the xDuino locomotive decoder. The CVs allow for the adjustment of driving characteristics, address, and other decoder functions.

The structure is divided into two main parts:
1.  **Standard CVs:** These CVs follow the RCN-225 standard, ensuring compatibility and intuitive operation with most digital command stations.
2.  **Proprietary Function Mapping:** This is a powerful, project-specific system for advanced configuration of lighting and auxiliary functions. It offers a high degree of flexibility beyond the standard NMRA function mapping.

## Section 2: Proprietary Advanced Function Mapping

The advanced function mapping is a highly flexible system based on three main components: **Logical Functions**, **Condition Variables**, and **Mapping Rules**. These are configured via dedicated CV blocks.

### 1. Logical Functions (CV 200-455) - **IMPLEMENTED**

Logical functions define *what* the decoder does (e.g., turn on a light, move a servo). Up to 32 logical functions can be configured. Each function occupies a block of 8 CVs.

- **Base CV:** `200`
- **Number of Blocks:** `32`
- **Block Size:** `8 CVs`

| CV (Base + Offset) | Name | Description | Value Range |
|---------------------|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Base + 0** | **Effect Type** | Defines the behavior of the function. | 0-255 |
| Base + 1 | Parameter 1 | First parameter for the chosen effect. | 0-255 |
| Base + 2 | Parameter 2 | Second parameter for the chosen effect. | 0-255 |
| Base + 3 | Parameter 3 | Third parameter for the chosen effect. | 0-255 |
| Base + 4 | Physical Output 1 ID | ID of the first associated output (0-based). | 0-255 |
| Base + 5 | Physical Output 2 ID | ID of the second output (e.g., for smoke generator fan). | 0-255 |
| Base + 6 | (Reserved) | | |
| Base + 7 | (Reserved) | | |

#### Effect Types and their Parameters

| Type ID | Effect | Parameter 1 | Parameter 2 | Parameter 3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Steady** | Brightness | - | - |
| 2 | **Dimming** | Brightness (full) | Brightness (dimmed) | - |
| 3 | **Flicker** | Base Brightness | Flicker Depth | Flicker Speed |
| 4 | **Strobe** | Frequency (Hz) | Duty Cycle (%) | Brightness |
| 5 | **Mars Light** | Frequency (mHz) | Peak Brightness | Phase Shift (%) |
| 6 | **Soft Start/Stop** | Fade-in time (ms/2) | Fade-out time (ms/2) | Target Brightness |
| 7 | **Servo** | Endpoint A (degrees) | Endpoint B (degrees) | Movement Speed |
| 8 | **Smoke Generator** | Heater on/off (0/1) | Fan Speed | - |

### 2. Condition Variables (CV 500-627) - **IMPLEMENTED**

Condition variables define *when* something should happen. They check the decoder's state (e.g., "Is the train moving forward?", "Is F1 active?"). Up to 32 condition variables can be configured. Each variable occupies a block of 4 CVs.

- **Base CV:** `500`
- **Number of Blocks:** `32`
- **Block Size:** `4 CVs`

| CV (Base + Offset) | Name | Description | Value Range |
|---------------------|------|-------------|-------------|

| Base + 1 | **Comparator** | How the source should be checked. | `1-8` |
| Base + 2 | **Parameter** | The value to compare against. | `0-255` |
| Base + 3 | (Reserved) | | |

#### Sources

| ID | Source | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Function Key** | State of a function key (F0-F28). Parameter = Key number. |
| 2 | **Direction** | The decoder's direction of travel. |
| 3 | **Speed** | The decoder's speed. |
| 4 | **Logical Function State** | State of another logical function. Parameter = LF ID (1-32). |

| 2 | `NEQ` (Not Equal) | Is not equal to |
| 3 | `GT` (Greater Than) | Is greater than |
| 4 | `LT` (Less Than) | Is less than |
| 5 | `GTE` (Greater Than or Equal) | Is greater than or equal to |
| 6 | `LTE` (Less Than or Equal) | Is less than or equal to |

### 3. Mapping Rules (CV 700-955) - **IMPLEMENTED**

Mapping rules are the core of the system. They link **Condition Variables** to **Logical Functions**. A rule might be: "IF Condition 1 is true AND Condition 2 is not true, THEN activate Logical Function 5." Up to 64 rules can be configured. Each rule occupies a block of 4 CVs.

- **Base CV:** `700`
- **Number of Blocks:** `64`

| Base + 1 | **Positive Condition ID** | ID of the condition variable (1-32) that must be TRUE. 0 = ignored. | `0-32` |
| Base + 2 | **Negative Condition ID** | ID of the condition variable (1-32) that must be FALSE. 0 = ignored. | `0-32` |
| Base + 3 | **Action** | What should happen to the logical function. | `1-3` |

#### Actions

| ID | Action | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `ACTIVATE` | Activates the logical function. |
| 2 | `DEACTIVATE` | Deactivates the logical function. |
| 3 | `SET_DIMMED` | Sets the "dimmed" state of the function (only for `EffectDimming`). |
