# Structure
- Keep sources in “src”, exceptions are possible depending on special technologies

# Documentation
- Keep ".md" documentation filenames uppercase snake
- Update ".md" documentation in "/docs" after adjusting ".xml" files
- Create and maintain on every change a README.md, add the usual summary
- Create a LICENSE.md if missing with AGPL 3.0 (Affero GNU)
- Create and maintain on every change a “CONTRIBUTE.md”
- Keep all documentation below in the ““docs” directory
- Create and maintain on every change a “HOW_TO_USE.md”, “USER_MANUAL.md”,
  “CORE_CONCEPTS.md”, “DEVELOPER_REFERENCE.md” and “TECHNICAL_DEBTS.md”

# Code
Follow the most used file & code naming conventions in the project:
- If not yet provided use “snake case”
- All C++ source code files (.h, .cpp) must be commented using Doxygen style. This includes file-level comments, class/struct comments, and comments for all public members (methods, variables).
- Comment lines if magic numbers or complex operations are used
-Vertically align all **equals signs** (`=`) and **other important operators** for readability.

# Testing
Add a comment to each testcase
- Summarizing the goal of the testcase in a short sentence.
- Summarizing the steps executed in 1-2 lines with longer sentences.
- List the references the underlying specification / documentation to each test case.

## Verification Techniques
- When verifying visual components (like signal dimensions), use Playwright to take screenshots of the generated output in the webtool.
- Compare these screenshots or the generated SVG/PNG assets against reference images provided (e.g., using image analysis scripts or side-by-side comparison).

# Add the following GitHub actions:
- Build and test the software after every push on every branch
- Provide all firmware examples with every release as assets
- Generate the Doxygen documents during build and provide the with the release assets

# Workflow
- The central specification for this project is RCN-213. When working on signal logic, always refer to `docs/RCN-213.MD`.
- After completing a phase from the roadmap, update `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.MD` to reflect the progress.
- After completing a task from `docs/SIGNAL_ROADMAP.MD`, update the roadmap to mark the task as complete.

# Signal Definitions
- Add outlines if available to each signal in the XML definition.
- Add the official technical short- and longnames to the signal aspects (e.g., short="Fb1" long="Fahrbegriff 1").
- The `name` attribute is mandatory, but `short` and `long` names are optional.
- Generate the SVG and PNG files from the XML definitions before each commit using `firmware/scripts/generate_svgs.py`.
