## Function Mapping

The core logic of this library revolves around DCC Function Mapping, which defines how function key presses on a DCC controller translate to actions on the decoder (e.g., turning on lights, activating effects).

This project adheres to the **RailCommunity (RCN) standards** for function mapping. The relevant specifications are located in the `/docs` directory:

-   **`RCN-225.EN.md`**: Defines the standard Configuration Variables (CVs).
-   **`RCN-227.EN.md`**: Defines the extended function mapping systems.

### Key Configuration Variable: CV 96

As defined in `RCN-225`, **CV 96** is used to select which function mapping system the decoder should use. The value written to this CV corresponds to one of the methods described in `RCN-227`.

Based on the specifications and the implementation in this codebase, the **"per-output" mapping systems (RCN-227, Section 3) are the primary and recommended methods.** The simpler "per-function" system (RCN-227, Section 2) is considered deprecated and has been removed from this project.

When working on features related to function mapping, always refer to these two documents to ensure compliance with the established standards.
